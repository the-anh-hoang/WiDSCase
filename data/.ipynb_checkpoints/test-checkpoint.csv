Kitsilano still has a vibrant cultural scene today, but young urban professionals and families now live there and enjoy a more upbeat version of the neighbourhood's laid-back vibe. Kitsilano is also the birthplace of the well-known yoga clothing company lululemon athletica. The neighbourhood, which is just over the Burrard Bridge from the downtown peninsula, brings together a variety of attractions, beaches, and parks, as well as residential streets and a few major business areas. The waterfront and West 16th Avenue are to the north and south, respectively, of ""Kits,"" as it is referred to locally. Burrard Street and Alma Street are to the east and west, respectively.

It’s even more surprising given its industrial history as a former shipyard sitting right next to the railway terminus. The area starts at Canada Place and stretches west to Stanley Park, and is bordered by Burrard Inlet to the north, West Georgia Street to the south. Coal Harbour is a charming mix of business and residential, being home to both the Vancouver Convention Centre as well as condo towers. Around this area you’ll find locals and visitors mingling on the Seawall, neighbourhood cafes and restaurants, a popular marina, and the odd harbour seal bobbing around and greeting passersby.<br /><br />The best way to eat and drink your way through this neighbourhood is by going where the locals go. And that means casual and slightly more upscale spots, where the focus is on great food and even better conversation.
