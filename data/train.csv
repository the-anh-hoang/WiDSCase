Most of the coolest and newest venues have relocated to Chinatown recently, but it still has its rough side.  Its not ideal for young children, but fantastic for a urban explorers, foodies, cyclists or remote workers.  Hastings Street is 4 blocks north and is not recommended.  All of the cool venues and amenities are south of there.  There are a few homeless folks who walk by, but there are a lot of families by day and couples by night that make it a safe neighborhood.  Here are a few highlights:<br /><br />Historic Chinatown Shops and Markets (many close at 6pm)<br />False Creek Seawall - 3 blocks Southwest<br />Trendy Dining and Restaurants (open late)<br />Vibrant Bar and Club Scene (open very very late)<br />Hip Coffee Shops and Brunch Spots<br />Vintage Shopping Boutiques<br />Historic Gastown<br />Science World<br />BC Place<br />Rogers Arena<br />Historic Strathcona<br />Close to Downtown<br />For",33173453,Thomas,within an hour,100%,90%,t,2,2,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",Downtown Eastside,49.2782153,-123.0992978,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,3,1.0,[],$896.00,3,1125,5.3,1125.0,8,13,13,45,19,19,5.0,5.0,4.84,5.0,5.0,4.47,4.95,f,1,1.57,1828
